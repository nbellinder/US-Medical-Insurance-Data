    "I was presented with Medical Insurance Data from around the country. I wanted to analyze trends in the data broken out by region and relating back to the national averages. Prior to analyzing the data, I believe premiums will be at their highest in the Southeast. This is based on my prior knowledge about age and BMI skews in the region. I think smoking will also be more prevelant in this region as it is still a wide cultural norm. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think the national average BMI will be in the overweght category, greater than 25 but less than 30. In fact, I do not think any region will be under 25. I think smoking rates will be under 20% everywhere but the Southeast as culture has changed rapidly in the last 30 years."
